## Creating a Vue Application

In this section we will introduce how to scaffold a Vue Single Page Application on your local machine. The created project will be using a build setup based on Vite and allow us to use Vue Single-File Components (SFCs).

Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Node.js installed and your current working directory is the one where you intend to create a project. Run the following command in your command line (without the $ sign):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">npm create vue@latest</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">pnpm create vue@latest</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn"># For Yarn (v1+) $ yarn create vue # For Yarn Modern (v2+) $ yarn create vue@latest # For Yarn ^v4.11 $ yarn dlx create-vue@latest </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">bun create vue@latest</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will install and execute create-vue, the official Vue project scaffolding tool. You will be presented with prompts for several optional features such as TypeScript and testing support:
